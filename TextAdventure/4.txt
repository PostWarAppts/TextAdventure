You are one of the many gods of this unnamed land.
Residing above it all, your people have adopted a policy 
of non interference for many years however recently 
you've felt the ripples of a period of great strife spreading 
across the lands.
Thus 6 of you have been sent down to influence the land 
in whatever direction you choose. 
Each of you have chosen to emerge in a different location 
break
across the lands, you must choose an avatar to inhabit 
your essence and tether you to the lands, should your 
avatar perish you will become unlinked and fall into 
the voids beyond.
